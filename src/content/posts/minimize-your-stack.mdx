<H2>We are developers and we want the newest tech</H2>
<P>Well, I agree every new tech is appealing and it is always a good idea to test out new framework and technologies. But when deciding what
  technology suites the project you are building, you need to make sure the tech-stack suites the ambitions and and requirements of your
  project. But let me tell you something: The best code is the code that does not exist.</P>

<H2>Customer Centric Thinking</H2>
<P>The biggest challenge in software development is not to build <Italic>something</Italic>, but to build <Italic>the right
  thing.</Italic> So before writing the first line of code, put yourself in the mind of the user, and ask yourself: </P>
<SortedList.Root>
  <SortedList.Item>Who will use this code?</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>In which situation will this person use your software?</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>What wants the user to archive when your user is using your software?</SortedList.Item>
</SortedList.Root>
<P>
  The better you understand your users, the better you can derive requirements for your software solution, and these are the requirements
  that matters. For example when the problem that your are solve with your software is for users that are outside in the nature - maybe even
  without internet connection - a web app is maybe not the right approach. If you want to build an application for people that are working
  in an office, a web app is maybe the right approach.

<P>
  I once was a part of a project that was made for biologists. People, that are collecting animal and plant material in the wilderness and
  than analysing the collected material in a laboratory. This project need a mobile application (e.g. for entering data of the collected
  material (when and where is the material collected)) but also a web application (for analysing the collected data). Both applications were
  different in design and functionality, because the same user was using the applications in different situations, with different
  intentions.
</P>

<H3>The user does not care about the technologie and the code that you are using</H3>
<P>
  To be honest the only people, who care about the technology that you are using are developers. The end-user is not caring about the code
  and how well it is structured, but he cares about new features and the stability of the system. So you do not need a micro service
  architecture, as long as you do not have a user base that is so big that you need to scale your application.
</P>
<P>
  I am also thinking that the most startups can start even with a serverless architecture until they reach a certain user base and the price
  for the services reached a point where it is cheaper to run your own servers.
