<H2>We Are Developers, and We Love New Tech</H2>
<P>Let's be honestâ€”new technology is exciting, and testing out the latest frameworks and tools is always tempting. However, when selecting a
  tech stack for your project, you need to ensure it aligns with your goals and requirements. But let me tell you something: The best code
  is the code that doesn't exist.</P>

<H2>Customer-Centric Thinking</H2>
<P>The biggest challenge in software development isnâ€™t just building <Italic>something</Italic>, but building <Italic>the right
  thing.</Italic> Before you write a single line of code, put yourself in the user's shoes and ask:</P>

<SortedList.Root>
  <SortedList.Item>Who will use this software?</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>In what situation will they use it?</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>What is their ultimate goal when using it?</SortedList.Item>
</SortedList.Root>

<P>The better you understand your users, the better you can define meaningful requirements. These are the ones that truly matter. For
  example, if your target users are often outdoors without an internet connection, a web app might not be the right approach. On the other
  hand, if your users work in an office, a web app could be the perfect fit.</P>

<P>I once worked on a project designed for biologistsâ€”people collecting plant and animal samples in the wild and later analyzing them in a
  lab. This required both a mobile app (for data collection in the field) and a web app (for data analysis). These applications had
  different designs and functionalities because the same users interacted with them in entirely different contexts and with different
  needs.</P>

<H3>Users Donâ€™t Care About Your Tech Stack</H3>

<P>The only people who care about the technology you use are developers. End users donâ€™t care about how well-structured your code isâ€”they
  care about new features and system stability. You donâ€™t need a microservices architecture unless your user base is large enough to require
  scaling.</P>

<P>So what do your users actually care about? It depends on your application. If youâ€™re in the early stages of product development, focus on
  delivering features quickly rather than implementing the latest tech trends. Fast feedback loops with users are far more valuable at this
  stage than using the newest tools.</P>

<H3>Doesn't New Technology Speed Up Development?</H3>
<P>Good question! I'm not against adopting new technology, but you should always ask yourself <Strong>why</Strong> you're choosing it. For
  example, in one startup I worked with, we relied heavily on hardware infrastructure. Instead of self-hosting, we chose AWSâ€”more expensive
  at first glance but ultimately more cost-effective than managing our own servers or hiring a DevOps engineer. This allowed us to focus on
  building the application rather than worrying about infrastructure.</P>

<P>For my personal projects, I use Google Cloud and Firebase. Are they the most cost-efficient options? Probably not. Are they the best for
  my use case? Maybe not. But they let me focus on development without worrying about infrastructure, and since my apps have a database
  abstraction layer, I can migrate away if needed.</P>

<H3>Practical Steps to Simplify Your Tech Stack</H3>

<SortedList.Root>
  <SortedList.Item>Audit your current stackâ€”identify redundant tools and services.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>Prioritize essential technologies that directly impact your users.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>Consider low-code or no-code solutions for non-core functionality.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>Leverage open-source frameworks and libraries.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>Use cloud platforms to reduce infrastructure maintenance.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>Implement a modular architecture for easy scalability.</SortedList.Item>
</SortedList.Root>

<H3>Common Pitfalls When Choosing a Tech Stack</H3>

<P>Many developers fall into common traps when selecting their technology stack. Here are some key mistakes to avoid:</P>

<SortedList.Root>
  <SortedList.Item><Strong>Shiny Object Syndrome</Strong> - Donâ€™t choose tech just because itâ€™s trending.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item><Strong>Over-Engineering</Strong> - Avoid unnecessary complexity that slows down development.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item><Strong>Ignoring Scalability</Strong> - Think long-term but donâ€™t over-optimize for problems you donâ€™t
    have.</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item><Strong>Lack of Documentation</Strong> - Ensure your stack has good documentation and community
    support.</SortedList.Item>
</SortedList.Root>

<H3>Frequently Asked Questions</H3>

<H3>How do I know if my tech stack is too complex?</H3>
<P>If youâ€™re spending more time managing infrastructure and dependencies than developing features, your stack may be overly complex.
  Simplifying your setup can free up resources for actual product development.</P>

<H3>When should I change my tech stack?</H3>
<P>Change your stack when it no longer meets business needs, creates maintenance headaches, or significantly slows down development.
  Otherwise, refactoring and optimizing your current stack may be the better approach.</P>

<H3>Should startups use microservices?</H3>
<P>Microservices add complexity and should only be used when scaling demands justify them. Most startups benefit from a monolithic or
  modular approach in the early stages.</P>

<H3>Final Thoughts</H3>
<P>When choosing a tech stack, keep it simple and maintainable. Focus on what you truly need for success, and most importantlyâ€”DONâ€™T FORGET
  YOUR USERS. By making thoughtful decisions, you can reduce technical debt, improve developer productivity, and build a product that truly
  serves its audience.</P>
