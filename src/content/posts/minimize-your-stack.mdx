<H2>We are developers and we want the newest tech</H2>
<P>Well, I agree every new tech is appealing and it is always a good idea to test out new framework and technologies.
  But when deciding what technology suites the project you are building, you need to make sure the tech-stack suites
  the ambitions and and
  requirements of your project. But let me tell you something: The best code is the code that does not exist.</P>

<H2>Customer Centric Thinking</H2>
<P>The biggest challenge in software development is not to build <Italic>something</Italic>, but to build <Italic>the
  right thing.</Italic> So before writing the first line of code, put yourself in the mind of the user, and ask
  yourself:</P>

<SortedList.Root>
  <SortedList.Item>Who will use this code?</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>In which situation will this person use your software?</SortedList.Item>
  <SortedList.Item>What wants the user to archive when your user is using your software?</SortedList.Item>
</SortedList.Root>

<P>The better you understand your users, the better you can derive requirements for your software solution, and these
  are the requirements that matters. For example when the problem that your are solve with your software is for users
  that are outside in the nature - maybe even without internet connection - a web app is maybe not the right approach.
  If you want to build an application for people that are working in an office, a web app is maybe the right
  approach.</P>

<P>I once was a part of a project that was made for biologists. People, that are collecting animal and plant material
  in the wilderness and
  than analysing the collected material in a laboratory. This project need a mobile application (e.g. for entering
  data of the collected
  material (when and where is the material collected)) but also a web application (for analysing the collected data).
  Both applications were
  different in design and functionality, because the same user was using the applications in different situations,
  with different
  intentions.</P>

<H3>The user does not care about the technology and the code that you are using</H3>

<P>To be honest the only people, who care about the technology that you are using are developers. The end-user is not
  caring about the code and how well it is structured, but he cares about new features and the stability of the
  system. So you do not need a micro service architecture, as long as you do not have a user base that is so big that
  you need to scale your application.</P>

<P>But what are your users actually care about? Well, it depends on the application that you are building. But if you
  start small and maybe also have to report to investors. Leave out everything that your are not confident, that it
  will speed up the development process. In early stages of the product life cycle, you want to be fast and deliver
  features quickly, so your users will get a better idea in which direction you go. Because the best thing early is to
  implement a fast feedback loop with your users. So you can validate your ideas and assumptions, this is way more
  important than using the newest tech.</P>

<H3>But doesn't new technology speed up our workflow?</H3>
<P>Good point! I am not against anything new, when you start building a project. What I am saying is, you need to be
  sure about <Strong>why</Strong> you pick it. For example once I was part of a startup, that was very relient on
  hardware infrastructure. So we choose to deploy our services on AWS - way more expensive than self hosting, isn't
  it? Well I question this, when you have to take care about your servers by yourself / or hire a DevOps engineer, it
  would be more expensive than deploying it a cloud provider. But the best thing: As we didn't need to care much about
  the hardware (besides a lot of configurationðŸ¤£), we were able to focus on our daily doing on delivering and building
  the application for our users.</P>

<P>My small 'free-time' projects are all hosted on the Google Cloud and use the Google services, like Firebase
  Database. Is it the best solution? When thinking about cost efficiency? No. Is it the best for my use-case? Maybe
  also not. But it is a solution that helps me no focus on the development and to build up a value stream for the
  project. I have a layer in my applications that decouple the database from the rest of the application, so
  whenever I reached the point to change the infrastructure, I can migrate away from the current stack, I am
  using.</P>

<H3>The best code is the code you don't write</H3>

<P>Every code that is written needs (some kind of) maintain. So the less code you need to write - the less afford you will have in the
  future. Business people know the term TCO - total cost of ownership. The term is describing how expensive it is to own a product. For
  example: After you bought a car, you still need to pay for insurance, gasoline, repairs and a lot of other stuff. This concept is also the
  case for software. If you offer a software service to other people, you need to pay for keeping it up to date, you need to fix security
  issue, update dependencies, pay for the hosting, and more. So often it is cheaper to buy some external software and service and connect it
  with yours than developing everything by yourself. A lot of 'problems' are also already solved by the Open Source community, so before
  doing everything by yourself, do some research, if you can use an already existing solution.</P>

<H3>Final thoughts</H3>
<P>Whenever you pick a tech stack, try to keep it simple and maintainable. Ask what you really need for success and DON'T FORGET YOUR
  USERS.</P>
