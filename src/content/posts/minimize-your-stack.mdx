<H2>We are developers and we want the newest tech</H2>
<P>Well, I agree every new tech is appealing and it is always a good idea to test out new framework and technologies.
    But when deciding what technology suites the project you are building, you need to make sure the tech-stack suites
    the ambitions and and
    requirements of your project. But let me tell you something: The best code is the code that does not exist.</P>

<H2>Customer Centric Thinking</H2>
<P>The biggest challenge in software development is not to build <Italic>something</Italic>, but to build <Italic>the
    right thing.</Italic> So before writing the first line of code, put yourself in the mind of the user, and ask
    yourself:</P>

<SortedList.Root>
    <SortedList.Item>Who will use this code?</SortedList.Item>
    <SortedList.Item>In which situation will this person use your software?</SortedList.Item>
    <SortedList.Item>What wants the user to archive when your user is using your software?</SortedList.Item>
</SortedList.Root>

<P>The better you understand your users, the better you can derive requirements for your software solution, and these
    are the requirements that matters. For example when the problem that your are solve with your software is for users
    that are outside in the nature - maybe even without internet connection - a web app is maybe not the right approach.
    If you want to build an application for people that are working in an office, a web app is maybe the right
    approach.</P>

<P>I once was a part of a project that was made for biologists. People, that are collecting animal and plant material
    in the wilderness and
    than analysing the collected material in a laboratory. This project need a mobile application (e.g. for entering
    data of the collected
    material (when and where is the material collected)) but also a web application (for analysing the collected data).
    Both applications were
    different in design and functionality, because the same user was using the applications in different situations,
    with different
    intentions.</P>

<H3>The user does not care about the technology and the code that you are using</H3>

<P>To be honest the only people, who care about the technology that you are using are developers. The end-user is not
    caring about the code and how well it is structured, but he cares about new features and the stability of the
    system. So you do not need a micro service architecture, as long as you do not have a user base that is so big that
    you need to scale your application.</P>

<P>But what are your users actually care about? Well, it depends on the application that you are building. But if you
    start small and maybe also have to report to investors. Leave out everything that your are not confident, that it
    will speed up the development process. In early stages of the product life cycle, you want to be fast and deliver
    features quickly, so your users will get a better idea in which direction you go. Because the best thing early is to
    implement a fast feedback loop with your users. So you can validate your ideas and assumptions, this is way more
    important than using the newest tech.</P>

<H3>But doesn't new technology speed up our workflow?</H3>
<P>Good point! I am not against anything new, when you start building a project. What I am saying is, you need to be
    sure about <Strong>why</Strong> you pick it. For example once I was part of a startup, that was very relient on
    hardware infrastructure. So we choose to deploy our services on AWS - way more expensive than self hosting, isn't
    it? Well I question this, when you have to take care about your servers by yourself / or hire a DevOps engineer, it
    would be more expensive than deploying it a cloud provider. But the best thing: As we didn't need to care much about
    the hardware (besides a lot of configurationðŸ¤£), we were able to focus on our daily doing on delivering and building
    the application for our users.</P>

<P>My small 'free-time' projects are all hosted on the Google Cloud and use the Google services, like Firebase
    Database. Is it the best solution? When thinking about cost efficiency? No. Is it the best for my use-case? Maybe
    also not. But it is a solution that helps me no focus on the development and to build up a value stream for the
    project. I have a layer in my applications that decouple the database from the rest of the application, so
    whenever I reached the point to change the infrastructure, I can migrate away from the current stack, I am
    using.</P>
