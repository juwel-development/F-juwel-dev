<H2>What is relevant when thinking about react project structure?</H2>
<P>Before thinking about how, we should make clear what is the goal of structuring a React project and what we are trying to archive.</P>
<P>At first, we should see the way, how we organize our code as a tool to communicate the architecture and the business language of our
  application. We want to create a structure that is easy to maintain, scale, but is easy to understand. Also, the structure of the project
  is like a map for developers, where to find what they are looking for and where to implement parts of the feature. So the folder
  structure needs to fit to the project that your are building.</P>

<H2>Do not overthink!</H2>
<P>That's the recommendation from the react team. I can subscribe to the core of this message. When you build something small, focus on
  getting it done. Also, there is a concept of incremental architecture. You can reorganise a small project whenever you feel like. You can
  change folder structures, split components without a major afford in a small application.</P>
<P>When your projects grows, your project structure will grow with it. You will see patterns that are repeating and you will see parts of
  your application that are growing. This is the time to iterate and refactor.</P>

<H2>What to do in a business context?</H2>
<P>When you are part of a organisation, you build something that need to be maintained for a long time, you need to think more about your
  project structure. In this case, I like to "zoom out" and take a look on the business? What parts of the application needs to be tested?
  What is the test strategy? Is the organization growing and is there a need in building a design system? How experienced is the development
  team? How much state do you will have in the client?</P>
<P>Next step, is to decide on a frontend architecture that fulfill the gathered requirements. If you have a department that is responsible
  for the design. You want to use the terminology that they are using in your codebase. So when they are using atomic design, you also want
  to reflect this approach in your project structure, because it enables developers to communicate very specific.</P>
<P>Also important is how your requirements are getting defined: If they have the form of: "When X happens, Y should happen.", you might want
  to use an architecture that works with events (for example Flux or an Event Driven Architecture). When a domain expert can find their
  explanation in your code - than this is good code.</P>

<H2>What parts has a common frontend?</H2>
<P>Business application usually include multiple pages. It interacts with a backend and also it </P>
