<H2>Why Project Structure Matters</H2>
<P>Before diving into the 'how,' let's define the 'why.' A well-structured React project enhances code readability, scalability, and
  maintainability. It serves as a roadmap for developers, making it easier to locate files, implement new features, and maintain consistency
  across the codebase.</P>
<P>Your project structure should communicate architecture decisions, align with your team's workflow, and scale with your application's
  complexity.</P>

<H2>Keep It Simple at First</H2>
<P>The React team advises against overcomplicating project structures. When starting a small project, focus on getting things done. You can
  always refactor and restructure as your app grows.</P>
<P>Adopting an incremental approach allows your architecture to evolve naturally. As patterns emerge and certain features expand, you'll
  recognize the right moments to introduce more structure.</P>

<H2>Scaling in a Business Context</H2>
<P>In a business setting, long-term maintainability is critical. Consider the following factors when structuring your project:</P>
<UnsortedList.Root>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Testing requirements and strategy</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Team experience and growth potential</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>State management complexity</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Need for a design system</UnsortedList.Item>
</UnsortedList.Root>
<P>Align your structure with business terminology. If your design team follows Atomic Design, reflect that in your component organization.
  If your requirements follow an event-driven model, consider Flux or a similar architecture.</P>

<H2>Core Parts of a React Project</H2>
<P>Most business applications consist of these core elements:</P>
<UnsortedList.Root>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Routing</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Pages</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>UI components</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Backend communication</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Business logic (e.g., validation, access control)</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>State management</UnsortedList.Item>
</UnsortedList.Root>
<P>A good project structure functions like a map, helping developers navigate these elements while maintaining clear boundaries.</P>

<H3>Feature Slices</H3>
<P>A feature slice groups all necessary components, logic, and state management for a specific feature into a single directory. This
  approach makes it easy to locate related code but can limit reusability.</P>
<P><strong>Advantages:</strong> This structure keeps everything related to a feature in one place, making it easier to develop and maintain.
  It also helps teams work in parallel without interfering with unrelated features.</P>
<P><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong> If features share a lot of logic, duplication may become an issue. It may also be difficult to determine
  where shared components or utilities should reside.</P>

<H3>Architecture-Based Organization</H3>
<P>You can structure your project by architecture you decided on. E.g.Clean architecture structures projects into four primary layers, each
  with a clear responsibility:</P>
<UnsortedList.Root>
  <UnsortedList.Item><strong>Presentation Layer:</strong> Contains UI components, views, and routing.</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item><strong>Application Layer:</strong> Contains mapping between your use cases and view models.</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item><strong>Domain Layer:</strong> Contains business entities and use cases logic.</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item><strong>Infrastructure Layer:</strong> Handles API communication, databases, and external services.</UnsortedList.Item>
</UnsortedList.Root>
<P><strong>Advantages:</strong> This structure promotes separation of concerns, making it easier to test and maintain. It also enhances
  scalability and allows for clear ownership of business logic.</P>
<P><strong>Tradeoffs:</strong> It introduces additional complexity, especially in small projects where simpler structures might suffice.
  There may also be a learning curve for teams unfamiliar with clean architecture.</P>

<H3>Handling Shared Logic</H3>
<P>Avoid generic <code>helpers</code> folders where possible. Instead, if a shared module emerges, consider isolating it as a separate
  package.</P>
<P>For instance, I maintain a <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@juwel-development/react-observable-tools">React Observable
  Tools</ExternalLink> package containing reusable hooks for integrating RxJS with React. This was extracted from a project to separate my
  relevant business logic from the logic to make the architecture work.</P>

<H2>Final Thoughts</H2>
<P>Your project structure should evolve with your application size, requirements, and team experience. Start simple and refine as
  needed.</P>
<P>Prioritize clean, maintainable code and follow principles like the Single Responsibility Principle. A thoughtful structure will help
  future-proof your project, making it easier to scale and adapt to new requirements.</P>
