<P>Did you ever work on a software project where something felt off, but you couldn‚Äôt quite pinpoint what it was?</P>

<P>Everything seems to be moving forward‚Äîfeatures are being developed, tickets are getting closed, and deployments happen regularly. Yet,
  over time, friction begins to build. Decisions become inconsistent, refactoring becomes a frequent task, and onboarding new developers
  takes longer than expected. The codebase seems to resist change rather than enabling it.</P>

<P>These are often signs of a missing or eroding software architecture. When architecture is absent, foundational decisions are made
  implicitly, rather than through deliberate design. The result? A system that evolves unpredictably, accumulating complexity that slows
  development and increases long-term costs.</P>

<H2>How to Recognize the Absence of Architecture</H2>
<H3>Knowledge Silos</H3>
<P>I once worked at a company where I began documenting the architecture of the system. During this process, I discovered two services that
  appeared to serve the same purpose. So, I asked: ‚ÄúWhen a new feature is being implemented, how do you decide which service to use?‚Äù The
  response I got was: ‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs easy. If Paul implements the feature, it will go into Service A. If John is implementing it, it will go
  into Service B.‚Äù</P>

<P>Let‚Äôs pause for a moment and think: What happens if John or Paul leaves the company? A new developer would then need to understand both
  services in order to comprehend the system and modify an existing feature. And also as there was not a team responsible for maintaining
  these services, the knowledge was only in the heads of John or Paul.</P>

<P>This answer also told me, that decision were made based on pure accident (whoever started to work on the feature first), rather than
  aligning with the requirements of the system.</P>

<H3>Accidental Discovered Requirements</H3>
<P>At the same company, another challenge emerged when they developed a service to connect their internal systems and external APIs through
  a centralized communication broker. The idea was promising: provide external services with a simple REST API and allow them to subscribe
  to events. However, instead of leveraging an existing message bus solution, the company opted to build one in-house.</P>

<P>After two years of development, the service was finally production-ready. The developers had thought through every technical
  detail‚Äîrecovery mechanisms, event subscriptions, and all the functionality a message bus should provide. The system worked flawlessly, at
  least from a purely technical standpoint. But when it came time to implement real-world use cases‚Äîsuch as sharing user data across all
  internal services‚Äîthe entire concept started to unravel.</P>

<P>What they hadn't considered was that different domains have different needs. The service was designed with a single database to store all
  the data objects it needed, but a "user" in one system didn‚Äôt necessarily mean the same thing in another. Across various domains, users
  could be employees, customers, creditors, or debtors. One domain didn't even have a "user" concept at all‚Äîit only worked with "employment
  contracts."</P>

<P>This led to a cascade of internal meetings, where product managers and developers from each domain had to sit down, explain their
  perspectives, and attempt to design a unified data model that worked for everyone. The process was slow, complex, and
  frustrating‚Äîespecially for those who had to compromise on their domain‚Äôs autonomy. What was once a well-defined data model within each
  domain was now entangled in cross-team dependencies. Suddenly, making changes required understanding how every other domain worked,
  significantly increasing cognitive load and development time.</P>

<P>After multiple release delays and the hiring of a new CTO, the company ultimately decided to shut down the project entirely. What was
  meant to streamline integration had instead created an unsustainable complexity. Years of effort and a significant financial investment
  were wasted‚Äîall because no one had considered the architectural implications before development began.</P>

<H3>Symptoms of Absent Software Architecture</H3>
<P>When software architecture is absent, the effects often manifest subtly at first but grow increasingly disruptive over time. Here are
  some indicators.</P>

<H4>Increasing Cross-Team Dependencies</H4>
<P>In the absence of architectural planning, teams frequently discover too late that their work depends on other teams in unexpected ways.
  Instead of being able to develop and deploy independently, they must coordinate constantly, leading to slowdowns, misalignment, and
  frustration. This is particularly problematic in organizations aiming for autonomous teams and continuous delivery.</P>

<H4>Inconsistent Technology Choices</H4>
<P>When there's no architectural vision, teams and individuals often make technology decisions in isolation. This leads to a patchwork of
  different frameworks, libraries, and patterns coexisting within the same system. For example, one part of the codebase might use one ORM
  while another relies on raw SQL queries. Frontend applications might be built using different component libraries, causing inconsistent
  user experiences. These inconsistencies create unnecessary cognitive load for developers and increase maintenance complexity.</P>

<H4>High Onboarding Effort</H4>
<P>A well-architected system should be easy to understand and navigate. When new developers join a project with no clear architectural
  guidelines, they must rely on tribal knowledge and reverse-engineering existing code to figure out how things work. This drastically
  increases onboarding time, making it difficult for teams to grow efficiently. The more effort it takes to onboard a new developer, the
  stronger the sign that architectural decisions were made without a clear structure.</P>

<H4>Scaling Problems Emerge Unexpectedly</H4>
<P>Without architectural foresight, scaling challenges often surface in unexpected ways. A system might work fine with a small user base but
  struggle as load increases. Bottlenecks appear in areas no one had anticipated because decisions about data flow, service communication,
  or state management were made ad hoc. Addressing these scaling issues later in development often requires extensive rework, leading to
  delays and budget overruns.</P>

<H4>Constant Refactoring Without Clear Direction</H4>
<P>Refactoring is a natural part of software development, but in the absence of a solid architectural foundation, it becomes an endless
  cycle. Developers find themselves constantly reworking the same areas of code, not because of iterative improvements, but because
  foundational design choices were never made‚Äîor were made inconsistently. Without a guiding structure, every attempt to clean up the code
  leads to new inconsistencies, making long-term maintenance a nightmare.</P>

<H4>Development Gets Unpredictable</H4>
<P>When architecture is absent, development becomes unpredictable. Estimates are unreliable, and deadlines are missed. Teams struggle to
  deliver features on time, as side effects appear. The lack of a clear architectural vision makes it difficult to predict
  how changes will impact the system, leading to a constant state of firefighting and reactive decision-making.</P>
