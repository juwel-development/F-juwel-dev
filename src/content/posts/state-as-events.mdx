<H2>The Data-Driven World We Live In</H2>
<P>'Data is money'‚Äîyou‚Äôve probably heard this phrase before. It‚Äôs true; data is the most valuable asset in the world today. Companies like
  Google, Facebook, and Amazon have built their business models around data.</P>
<P>Applications, whether web or mobile, revolve around data: displaying it, processing it, and sending it to backends or external systems.
  The challenge lies in managing data efficiently to provide seamless user experiences.</P>

<H2>The CRUD Approach vs. Event-Driven Architecture</H2>
<P>Many web applications follow a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) approach: you fetch a resource from the backend, allow the user to
  modify it, and send the updated resource back. This results in UI structures built around data operations‚Äîlist views, create/update forms,
  and delete actions. For example, if you‚Äôre building a blog, a CRUD mindset means focusing on creating, updating, and deleting posts.</P>

<P>However, humans don‚Äôt think in terms of updating data. We use applications to accomplish tasks quickly. Wouldn‚Äôt it be more intuitive to
  model the application around tasks instead of data manipulations? For example, instead of manually updating post statuses, you could
  display a list of unpublished posts with a ‚ÄòRelease‚Äô button to quickly publish them.</P>

<H2>Modeling Around Events</H2>

<H3>Starting with Commands</H3>
<P>To simplify the shift in thinking, let‚Äôs introduce a small trick: separate UI interactions from UI state. Instead of directly modifying
  data, the UI should only dispatch *commands*‚Äîuser intents that trigger backend logic. Consider this example of emitting an event to a
  global <ExternalLink href={"https://rxjs.dev/guide/subject"}>RxJS subject.</ExternalLink></P>

```tsx
import { Subject } from 'rxjs';

const GlobalEvent$ = new Subject();

class ReleasePostEvent {
  public readonly type = 'POST_RELEASE_COMMAND';
  public readonly payload = new ReleasePostPayload();
}

class ReleasePostPayload {
  public postId: string;
}

const UiComponent = ({ postId }) => {
  const handleReleasePost = (postId: string) => {
      const event = new ReleasePostEvent();
      event.payload.postId = postId;
      GlobalEvent$.next(event);
  };

  return <button onClick={() => handleReleasePost(postId)}>Release</button>;
};
```

<H3>What Happens to These Events?</H3>
<P>This is where the magic happens: you can handle events however you like. üöÄ</P>
<P>Instead of tightly coupling state changes to UI actions, events allow for greater flexibility. Here are some possibilities:</P>
<UnsortedList.Root>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Update stored models on the server.</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Send events to analytics tools like <ExternalLink
    href="https://posthog.com/">PostHog.</ExternalLink></UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Log events to the browser console during development.</UnsortedList.Item>
</UnsortedList.Root>
<P>Imagine a customer requests a feature: *‚ÄúWhen X happens, can you also do Y?‚Äù* With an event-driven model, you‚Äôre already prepared to
  handle it efficiently.</P>

<H3>Combining Events for Smarter UI State</H3>
<P>Consider a loading indicator: in a CRUD-based system, you typically set a `boolean` flag in the application state. With events, you don‚Äôt
  need explicit state management. If a ‚Äòloading‚Äô command is dispatched and a corresponding ‚Äòresource loaded‚Äô event hasn‚Äôt been received yet,
  you know the application is still loading. The logic could look like this:</P>

```typescript
import { filter, map } from 'rxjs';

const isLoading$ = GlobalEvent$.pipe(
  filter(event => event.type === 'LOADING_COMMAND' || event.type === 'RESOURCE_LOADED'),
  map(event => event.type === 'LOADING_COMMAND')
);
```

<H3>Querying Data Efficiently</H3>
<P>When designing applications, it's crucial to separate querying data from emitting commands. Fortunately, modern technologies allow
  pushing updates from servers to clients, making data retrieval seamless. A repository pattern might look like this:</P>

```typescript
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';

interface IPostRepository {
  readonly Posts$: Observable<Post[]>;
  readonly Post$: Observable<Post>;

  loadPost(postId: string): void;
  loadPosts(): void;
}
```

<P>Your UI components can subscribe to `Posts$` to reactively display data as it updates.</P>

<H2>When Should You Use Event-Driven Architecture?</H2>
<P>Not every application needs an event-driven approach. If you‚Äôre building a static website with minimal user interactions, a CRUD-based
  architecture might suffice. However, consider using event-driven architecture in scenarios such as:</P>
<UnsortedList.Root>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Applications with high user interactions (e.g., dashboards, collaborative tools).</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Systems where multiple sources modify application state (e.g., real-time messaging apps).</UnsortedList.Item>
  <UnsortedList.Item>Applications requiring reactive state management and asynchronous processing.</UnsortedList.Item>
</UnsortedList.Root>
<P>By rethinking state management and structuring applications around events instead of direct data manipulations, you can build more
  scalable, flexible, and maintainable frontend architectures.</P>

<H2>Conclusion</H2>
<P>Moving beyond CRUD-based thinking and embracing event-driven architecture enables applications to be more responsive and adaptable. By
  focusing on *what happens* instead of *how data is updated*, you create a system where business logic is decoupled from UI interactions,
  making your frontend more powerful and resilient.</P>
